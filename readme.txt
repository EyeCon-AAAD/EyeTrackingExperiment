The file faceUtilities and facialLandMarks is for auxilary functions that takes a picture and return the cropped eye pictures.
The file createDatabase creates a database of cropped eye pictures with the corresponding mouse location.
The file createDatabaseWithVideo creates a database of cropped eye pictures with the corresponding black point location.
The file train.py is responsible for training the models.
The file test.py is responsible for the live gaze estimation from following the mouse location
The file testWithVideo is responsible for the live gaze estimation from following black points on the screen from the video

Requirments:
